# Time eries analysis on Human Motion Primitives Dataset

### Description
`Use clustering and multi-dimensional analysis to identify human motion primitive activities
measured by accelerometer readings.`

### Role detail:
- Convert data from a time domain to a frequency domain by Fast Fourier Transform.
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA, t-SNE, Autoencoders, LDA, UMAP.
- Clustering with K-means Clustering.
